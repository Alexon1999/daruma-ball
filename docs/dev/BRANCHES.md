## Branches

- `develop`: The default branch for active development. New features are added and bugs are fixed on this branch. it represents the latest development version.
- `master`: The branch that represents the latest stable release of the project.

## Workflow

1. Work on new features and bug fixes on the `develop` branch.
2. When ready, merge the `develop` branch into the `master` branch to create a new release.

You could also implement a CI/CD pipeline to automatically build and deploy the application on the `master` branch when you merge `develop` into `master`.

## Branch Protection

- Protecting the `master` branch ensures that only authorized contributors can make changes to it and prevent accidental or malicious changes to the stable release version of the project.
- Protecting the `develop` branch ensures that all changes are reviewed and approved by a maintainer before they are merged.
- You can use branch protection rules to automatically enforce specific policies, such as requiring a minimum number of code review approvals, or requiring that tests pass before a pull request can be merged.
